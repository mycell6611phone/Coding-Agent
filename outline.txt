ssistant: Certainly! I can guide you through implementing a system where an agent interacts with a server to ensure contextually appropriate responses by using past messages. Iâ€™ll outline a basic structure using Python, which is a common choice for web applications and agents. Note that the implementation will be somewhat abstract, as specific details like server communications and data storage will vary based on your setup.

### Prerequisites

1. **Server Operation**: You need a server that can evaluate queries and determine if more context is needed.
2. **Message Storage**: You'll have a way to store and retrieve past messages, such as a database or an in-memory structure if the volume is small.
3. **Communication Protocol**: Define a protocol for how the agent communicates with the server (could be HTTP REST, WebSocket, etc.).

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Environment Setup

Ensure you have the necessary libraries. You'll likely need a web server framework (e.g., Flask or FastAPI) if you're coding the server and agent.

```bash
pip install flask
```

#### 2. Implementing the Agent

Create a basic structure for the agent. This will involve sending user queries to a server and managing past messages.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Simulated database of past messages
past_messages = [
    {"timestamp": 1, "message": "Hello, I need help with my order."},
    {"timestamp": 2, "message": "My order number is 12345."},
    {"timestamp": 3, "message": "I'm having an issue accessing my account."}
]

def search_past_messages(user_query):
    # Implement a simple keyword search or similarity check
    results = []
    keywords = user_query.lower().split()
    for past in past_messages:
        if any(keyword in past["message"].lower() for keyword in keywords):
            results.append(past["message"])
    return results

def send_to_server(query):
    # Simulate server communication and response
    # Here, it's a mock function for demonstration
    needs_more_info = "details" in query.lower() or "clarify" in query.lower()
    response = {"answer": "This is the server's response.", "requiresMoreInfo": needs_more_info}
    return response

@app.route('/process', methods=['POST'])
def process_user_question():
    user_question = request.json.get('question', '')
    
    initial_response = send_to_server(user_question)

    while initial_response['requiresMoreInfo']:
        # Gather past message context
        past_context = search_past_messages(user_question)
        
        # Combine past messages with the current question
        enhanced_query = user_question + " " + " ".join(past_context)
        
        # Resend the enriched query to the server
        initial_response = send_to_server(enhanced_query)

    return jsonify({'response': initial_response['answer']})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=8000)
```

#### 3. Testing and Expansion

- **Test the Agent**: Use `curl` or Postman to test the agent. Send a JSON object with a "question" field to `localhost:8000/process`.
- **Enhance Searching**: You can upgrade the `search_past_messages` function to use natural language processing (NLP) libraries like SpaCy or NLTK for improved search results.
- **Server Improvements**: The `send_to_server` function is currently simulated. In your actual deployment, replace it to make real HTTP requests to a backend service that evaluates the queries.
- **Data Storage**: Integrate a database for managing past messages efficiently if needed (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).

By following this structure, you'll set up a simple agent capable of enriching user queries through past message context before querying the server. Customize the logic and expand upon this example to fit your specific requirements.
